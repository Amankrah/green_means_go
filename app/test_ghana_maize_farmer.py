Ghana Maize Farmer Sustainability Assessment Test
==================================================

A minimal test script simulating a maize farmer in Ghana using basic
farmer-provided information that they can easily supply without LCA expertise.

The test demonstrates how the African LCA backend translates simple farmer
inputs into comprehensive environmental impact assessments following
proper LCA methodological processes.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT SUMMARY:
=============================================================

[CLIMATE] CARBON FOOTPRINT: {gwp:.1f} kg CO2 equivalent
   -> This is the greenhouse gases produced by your maize farming
   -> Lower numbers are better for climate change

[WATER] WATER USE: {water:.1f} cubic meters  
   -> Total water needed for your maize production
   -> Includes rainfall and irrigation

[LAND] LAND IMPACT: {land_use:.1f} square meter-years
   -> Land area and time needed for your farming system
   -> Considers soil health and land productivity

[SCORE] ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT INDEX: {single_score:.3f} (0-1 scale)
   -> 0.0 = Excellent environmental performance
   -> 0.5 = Typical farming impact level  
   -> 1.0 = High environmental impact
   -> Your score: {self.interpret_score_category(single_score)}
   -> This combines climate, water, land, and biodiversity impacts

DATA CONFIDENCE: {confidence}
