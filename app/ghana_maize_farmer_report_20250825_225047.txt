=============================================================

FARM DETAILS:
- Farmer: Kwame Asante - Maize Farm
- Location: Ghana
- Assessment Date: 2025-08-26
- Maize Production: Maize (Zea mays) (7500kg)

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT SUMMARY:
=============================================================

[CLIMATE] CARBON FOOTPRINT: 10500.0 kg CO2 equivalent
   -> This is the greenhouse gases produced by your maize farming
   -> Lower numbers are better for climate change

[WATER] WATER USE: 12000.0 cubic meters  
   -> Total water needed for your maize production
   -> Includes rainfall and irrigation

[LAND] LAND IMPACT: 21000.0 square meter-years
   -> Land area and time needed for your farming system
   -> Considers soil health and land productivity

[SCORE] ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT INDEX: 0.857 (0-1 scale)
   -> 0.0 = Excellent environmental performance
   -> 0.5 = Typical farming impact level  
   -> 1.0 = High environmental impact
   -> Your score: HIGH IMPACT - Significant improvement needed
   -> This combines climate, water, land, and biodiversity impacts

DATA CONFIDENCE: Low
   -> How reliable these results are based on available data
   -> Ghana-specific data improves accuracy

IMPORTANT INSIGHTS FOR YOUR FARM:
