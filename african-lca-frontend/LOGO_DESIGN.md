# Green Means Go - Logo Design

## Design Concept

The Green Means Go logo is a creative and meaningful representation of the platform's mission: sustainable food systems assessment across Africa.

### Visual Elements

1. **Circular Green Gradient Background**
   - Represents the Earth, sustainability, and continuous improvement
   - Green gradient symbolizes growth and environmental consciousness
   - Circular shape represents the lifecycle concept central to LCA

2. **Stylized Africa Continent**
   - Subtle silhouette of the African continent in semi-transparent white
   - Centers the platform's geographic focus
   - Integrated seamlessly into the design without overpowering other elements

3. **Wheat/Grain Stalk (Left)**
   - Golden wheat representing agricultural production
   - Multiple grain seeds showing abundance and food security
   - Symbolizes the farm production side of the value chain

4. **Growing Sprout (Right)**
   - Fresh green sprout with leaves
   - Represents sustainability, growth, and regeneration
   - Symbolizes the platform's goal of helping systems improve

5. **Circular Arrow (Center)**
   - Life cycle symbol representing LCA methodology
   - Continuous improvement and sustainability cycle
   - The "go" in Green Means Go - forward movement and progress

### Color Palette

- **Primary Green**: `#10b981` - Emerald green representing growth and sustainability
- **Secondary Green**: `#059669` - Deeper emerald for gradient depth
- **Accent Gold**: `#fbbf24` - Warm gold for wheat/grain representing agriculture
- **Leaf Green**: `#34d399` - Fresh green for the growing sprout
- **White**: Semi-transparent and solid white for contrast and clarity

### Symbolism

The logo tells a complete story:
- **From Farm to Processing**: Wheat (production) + Sprout (growth/processing)
- **African Context**: Continent silhouette grounds the mission geographically
- **Lifecycle Thinking**: Circular arrow represents LCA methodology
- **Sustainability**: Green palette and natural elements
- **Progress**: The circular flow suggests continuous improvement

### Usage

- **Header Logo**: 48px size with company name
- **Footer Logo**: 40px size
- **Favicon**: Simplified version at 32px
- **Apple Icon**: Enhanced version at 180px for iOS devices

The design is scalable, works well at all sizes, and maintains clarity even when reduced to favicon dimensions.
