## Impact Categories and Confidence Levels

### High Confidence Data Available
- **Global Warming Potential**: Both countries have UNFCCC submissions
- **Land Use**: Agricultural ministry statistics available
- **Water Consumption**: River basin and irrigation data available

### Medium Confidence Data Available  
- **Terrestrial Acidification**: Limited direct measurement, estimated from practices
- **Eutrophication**: Some research on water quality impacts

### Low Confidence Data Available
- **Toxicity Categories**: Very limited African-specific toxicity studies
- **Biodiversity Impacts**: Regional estimates available but limited specificity
- **Resource Scarcity**: Economic data available but environmental impact correlation limited

## Data Gaps and Limitations

### Common Gaps
1. Limited lifecycle assessment studies specifically for African agricultural systems
2. Inconsistent data collection methods between regions
3. Limited long-term monitoring data
4. Smallholder farming systems under-represented in studies

### Recommendations for Data Integration
1. Prioritize country-specific data where confidence is high
2. Use regional African averages where country data unavailable
3. Fall back to global averages adjusted for African conditions
4. Clearly indicate data sources and confidence levels in results
5. Update data regularly as new studies become available

## Next Steps for Implementation
1. Establish partnerships with listed institutions for data access
2. Create standardized data collection protocols
3. Develop regional adjustment factors for global data
4. Implement version control for data updates
5. Build uncertainty propagation into assessment calculations
